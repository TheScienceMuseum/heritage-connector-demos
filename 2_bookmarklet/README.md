# bookmarklet

A bookmarklet to show connections from one page its direct connections in the graph. Meant to be a quick way to prototype future collection website widgets.

The idea and backbone of the code are based on [Roderic Page](https://github.com/rdmpage)'s work for the [TANC Heritage PIDs](https://tanc-ahrc.github.io/HeritagePIDs/) project.
