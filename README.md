# Heritage Connector public demos

This repo contains various demos and sketches of demos for Heritage Connector. Namely:

1. an interactive streamlit app showing NER and entity linking which uses static data for speed (not hosted at the moment)
2. a [bookmarklet](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/heritage-connector-demos/tree/main/2_bookmarklet) to view connections from an SMG collection, blog or journal page
3. a macro [visualisation](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritage-connector-demos/3_visualisation/index.html) of the whole collection/knowledge graph
4. a [visualisation](https://thesciencemuseum.github.io/heritage-connector-demos/4_visualisation_vanda/index.html) of the combined SMG and V&A* collections
5. maps ([map 1](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1rVGvHIKPs-xrAJfz9Jkv08hvkQaY9UHe&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&z=1); [map 2](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1x0y7BU3bVtcn4qj4hjaDV4AYG06vZ2g-&ll=-3.81666561775622e-14%2C0&z=1)) of all the places in the knowledge graph

## A note on cross-collection linking

As part of the project we looked into how knowledge graphs like the one we've built could be used to link collections. To do this, we processed a subset of the V&A's digital collection alongside the Science Museum Group's collection. [This page](https://github.com/TheScienceMuseum/heritage-connector-demos/blob/main/V%26A_collection.md) describes the subset of the V&A collection we processed.
