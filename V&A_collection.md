# The V&A Collection in Heritage Connector

For the purposes of [the project](https://www.sciencemuseumgroup.org.uk/project/heritage-connector/), we have processed only a subset of the V&A's collection into the Heritage Connector knowledge graph. We aimed for this to be a part of the collection which would share some overlap in terms of topics, themes, places, and involved people and organisations with the Science Museum Group's collection.

## Details of the subset

The subset of the collection we've processed can be described by the following collections and categories. Each link takes you to a search page filtered on that collection or category.
